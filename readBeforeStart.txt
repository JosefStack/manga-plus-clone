🎚️ 6️⃣ Slider logic (this is architecture, not syntax)

You learned how to:

Think in indexes, not slides

Slide by card width, not pixels

Handle odd card counts cleanly

Reset a slider instantly by removing transition

Key insight

lastIndex = total - visibleCount;


Mental rule

UI animation problems are math problems first.

🎯 7️⃣ General frontend maturity upgrade

What changed today:

You stopped “trying CSS until it works”

You started asking why the browser behaves this way

You debugged layout issues systematically

You’re now thinking in:

stacking contexts

intrinsic sizes

layout constraints

rendering rules

That’s the difference between:

“I can build layouts”
and
“I understand the browser”

🧩 If I had to summarize in ONE sentence:

You learned how the browser decides size, order, and visibility — and how to take control of it.

That’s real progress.

If you want, next we can:

turn the slider into a reusable component

add touch/drag physics

refactor parts into CSS variables

or clean up this layout like a production codebase

Just tell me what you want to tasckle next 🚀
